## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- [Astro](https://astro.build)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [Fluid Tailwind](https://fluid.tw)

### Continued development

I expected the next project coming from [Interactive Rating Component](https://interactive-rating-component.frilly.dev) to be a bit more JS-involved so I can try more of Solid.js, turns out this project is completely JS-free. I'm very happy with the result as Frontend Mentor also challenged to make this project without any JavaScript.
